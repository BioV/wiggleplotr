# wiggleplotr
Wiggleplotr is an R package to plot alternative transcript structures of a gene and RNA-Seq read coverage across them. A key feature of wiggleplotr is that it allows to scale introns to a fixed length. This feature greatly improves visualisation of alternative transcription events such as alternative promoter usage, alternative splicing and alternative 3â€™ end usage, because alternative exons are shown immediately adjacent to each other.

## Installation
Wiggleplotr R package can we installed from GitHub.
